# PROJECT TITLE: Anna's Personal Website
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/1skxdLdnwn8?si=-71rRA-YdnxIsjU9>
#### Description: Anna's Personal Website is a comprehensive digital portfolio that showcases my professional journey as an educator and technology integrator. Built as a responsive single-page application, this website serves as a dynamic platform to present my teaching philosophy, educational projects, technical skills, and professional background. The site combines aesthetic design with functional excellence, demonstrating my commitment to bridging digital innovation with educational practices.
## File Structure and Technical Implementation

### Core HTML Structure (index.html)

The main HTML file implements a sophisticated single-page architecture with clearly defined sections:

#### Head Section & Meta Configuration:
- Comprehensive meta tags for SEO optimization, including Open Graph protocols for social media sharing.
- Google Analytics integration for visitor tracking and performance monitoring.
- Materialize CSS framework via CDN for consistent Material Design components.
- Custom favicon set for multiple devices and browsers.
- Viewport configuration for responsive behavior across all screen sizes.

#### Navigation System:
The site features a three-tier navigation approach:
- **Desktop Navigation**: Fixed side navigation panel with profile image and section links.
- **Mobile Navigation**: Collapsible hamburger menu for smaller screens.
- **Active State Management**: Visual indicators for the current section with smooth scrolling.

#### Section Architecture:
- **Hero Section**: Features Typed.js animation for dynamic text effects and social media links.
- **About Section**: Personal introduction with teaching philosophy.
- **Experience Section**: Professional timeline with detailed role descriptions.
- **Projects Section**: Interactive card-based project showcase with hover effects.
- **Skills Section**: Categorized technical and educational tool proficiency.
- **Education Section**: Academic background with relevant coursework.
- **Contact Section**: Multiple contact methods with integrated action buttons.

### Custom Styling (style.css)
The custom CSS extends and customizes the Materialize framework with several key design decisions:

#### Profile Image Styling:
```css
.profile-pic {
  border: 6px solid rgba(0, 77, 64, 0.4);
  border-radius: 50%;
  margin: -31px;
}
